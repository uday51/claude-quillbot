🔹 Project Title: Automating AI-Powered Content Generation and Storage using Claude, Selenium, and AWS

🚀 Description:

In this project, I built a complete automation pipeline that generates human-like responses using Anthropic's Claude AI, enhances the content with QuillBot paraphrasing, and stores the final output securely in AWS S3.

🧠 What it does:

Uses Claude 3.5 Haiku API to generate responses to user queries in a helpful and conversational tone.

Automates a browser using Selenium to input the response into QuillBot’s paraphrasing tool for better readability and uniqueness.

Extracts the paraphrased output and uploads it as a .txt file to Amazon S3 with a unique filename using UUID.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Claude AI (Anthropic API)

Selenium (Browser Automation)

QuillBot (Web-based NLP Tool)

Python

AWS S3 (Cloud Storage)

Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)

📌 Skills Demonstrated:

AI API Integration

Web Automation with Selenium

Cloud Storage Automation

End-to-End Workflow Automation

Data Handling and Secure Storage

This project showcases how multiple tools can be integrated to create a seamless content creation and management pipeline — useful for marketers, bloggers, and content teams.
